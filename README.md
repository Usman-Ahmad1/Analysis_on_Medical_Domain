# Kidney Disease Analysis and Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This project consists of two interconnected Jupyter Notebooks that focus on analyzing a kidney disease dataset and applying machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The objective is to extract meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis and develop a reliable model to assist in detecting kidney disease.

## Notebooks

### ðŸ“˜ `kidney-analysis-ipnb.ipynb`

This notebook performs the initial **data exploration and analysis**:

- Loads and inspects the kidney disease dataset
- Cleans and preprocesses the data
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizes distributions, trends, and correlations between key variables

### ðŸ¤– `ML.ipynb`

This notebook focuses on **machine learning modeling**:

- Prepares features and labels for training
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Applies machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall
- Compares model performance to select the best-performing model

---

## Objectives

- Understand the structure and characteristics of kidney disease-related data.
- Clean and transform the dataset to prepare for analysis and modeling.
- Visualize trends and anomalies to uncover patterns.
- Train and test machine learning models to classify and predict kidney disease.
- Evaluate performance and provide insight for future enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ for data manipulation and numerical operations
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` â€“ for building and evaluating machine learning models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Notebooks
Clone or download this project folder.

Open both notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook kidney-analysis-ipnb.ipynb
jupyter notebook ML.ipynb
Run the cells in order to view the analysis and model results.

Dataset
The kidney disease dataset contains several clinical attributes such as:

Blood Pressure

Albumin Levels

Sugar Levels

Hemoglobin, Creatinine

Red and White Blood Cell Counts

Presence of symptoms or markers related to kidney function

Disclaimer: Use of this dataset should adhere to ethical standards and data privacy regulations, especially if working with real patient data.

Results & Insights
Data cleaning significantly improved model training quality.

EDA revealed key clinical indicators correlated with kidney disease.

Among various models tested, [insert top model here, e.g., Random Forest] showed the highest performance in predicting kidney disease.

Future Enhancements
Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

Incorporate feature engineering for better performance

Integrate model explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME)

Deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions
